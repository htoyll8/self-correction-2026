"""
Benchmark-agnostic task representation shared by every dataset loader.
A loader turns a raw benchmark example into a `Task`. The evaluator scores a candidate by running `setup`, then the candidate program, then `prelude` (e.g. binding `candidate` for HumanEval), then each statement in `tests` (one assert each, for partial credit).
